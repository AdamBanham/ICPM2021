# ICPM2021 - Data Sources
A reproduction repository for MIMIC III ETL

Ensure that you have access to MIMIC III dataset and have completed the required ethics training to be using this publicly available dataset.<br><br>
The MIMIC III dataset and access information can be found at: <br>https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/ <br>
If you wanted an in-depth understanding of the data available in this dataset, please refer to the official documentation at: <br>https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iii/ <br><br>
We assume that you already have access to the data to reproduce the ETL steps for creating two datasets used for a ICPM2021 submission, a movements log and a procedure log. <br>
We also assume that you have an AWS account and are familiar with python, SQL and AWS services. In-depth knowledge of any of these languages are not needed, but some introduction knowledge will be helpful.<br>
